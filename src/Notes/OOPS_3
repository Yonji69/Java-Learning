There are Mainly 2 types pf polymorphism
1) Compile time or Static Polymorphism
2) Run Time Polymorphism

--> Compile Time Polymorphism: where the behaviour and the return type changes at compile time ,( after all the objects are created)
                                Does not depend on inheritance from another class
                                its also called as the static binding
        class Calculator {
            int add(int a, int b) {
                return a + b;
            }

            double add(double a, double b) {
                return a + b;
            }

            int add(int a, int b, int c) {
                return a + b + c;
            }
        }

---> Run Time Polymorphism : Require inheritance and it needs an override annotation
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
