ABSTRACT CLASS – KEY NOTES
WHAT AN ABSTRACT CLASS IS

→ An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly.
→ It is used to define a structure that child classes must follow.
→ If a class contains at least one abstract method
→ the class itself must be abstract.

ABSTRACT METHODS

→ Abstract methods do not have a body.
→ Any class that extends an abstract class
→ must implement all abstract methods
→ unless the child class is also abstract.

RULES SHOWN IN AbstractBase

→ Abstract classes can have variables.
→ static final variables
→ act as constants
→ cannot be changed.
→ Abstract classes can have static methods.
→ Abstract classes cannot have abstract static methods.
→ Abstract classes cannot have abstract constructors.

OBJECT CREATION

→ You cannot create an object of an abstract class directly.
→ You can create an object using:
→ An anonymous inner class
→ that implements all abstract methods.
→ A child class
→ must implement all abstract methods
→ to be instantiated.

INHERITANCE BEHAVIOR

→ AbstractChild must override:
→ career()
→ degree()
→ Static methods of an abstract class
→ are accessed using:
→ AbstractBase.hello()

INTERFACE – KEY NOTES
WHAT AN INTERFACE IS

→ An interface is a pure blueprint of a class.
→ It specifies:
→ what a class should do
→ not how it should do it.
→ Interfaces support multiple inheritance.

INTERFACE PROPERTIES

→ All methods
→ are public and abstract by default.
→ All variables
→ are public
→ static
→ final by default.
→ Interfaces cannot be instantiated.

IMPLEMENTATION RULES

→ A class uses implements
→ to inherit an interface.
→ The implementing class
→ must override all interface methods.
→ Method visibility
→ must be public
→ when implementing interface methods.

RELATIONSHIP WITH ABSTRACT CLASSES

→ An interface
→ cannot implement an abstract class.
→ An abstract class
→ can implement an interface.
→ Interfaces
→ remove implementation details
→ from higher-level classes.

INTERFACE IMPLEMENTATION – NOTES FROM InterfaceImpl

→ InterfaceImpl implements InterfaceClass.
→ The method setName():
→ overrides the interface method.
→ updates internal state (name).
→ Getter and display methods
→ are normal class methods
→ not part of the interface.
→ Interfaces
→ define required behavior
→ not helper or utility methods.
